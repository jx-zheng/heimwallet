Alzheimer's disease and dementia affect many of our loved ones every year; in fact, **76,000 diagnoses** of  dementia are made every year in Canada. One of the largest issues caused by Alzheimer's is the loss of ability to make informed, cognitive decisions about their finances. This makes such patients especially vulnerable to things such as scams and high-pressure sales tactics. Here's an unfortunate real-life example of this: https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/senior-alzheimers-upsold-bell-products-source-1.6014904 We were inspired by this heartbreaking story to build HeimWallet.

HeimWallet is a digital banking solution that allows for **supervision** over a savings account owned by an individual incapable of managing their finances, and is specifically **tailored** to patients with Alzheimer's disease or dementia. It can be thought of as a mobile debit card linked to a savings account that only allows spending if certain conditions set by a designated *guardian* are met.

It allows a family member or other trusted guardian to set a **daily allowance** for a patient and **keep track of their purchases**. It also allows guardians to keep tabs on the **location of patients via GPS** every time a purchase is attempted, and to authorize or refuse attempted purchases that go beyond the daily allowance. This ensures that patients and their guardians can have confidence that the patient's assets are in safe hands. Further, the daily allowance feature empowers patients to be independent and **shop with confidence**, knowing that their disease will not be able to dominate their finances.

This repository contains the HeimWallet cross-platform mobile app, built with React Native. It also contains the backend, built with Flask.
